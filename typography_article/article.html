        During the Stone Age in what is now western Cameroon, four children who perished before their prime were buried
        in a natural rock shelter. Now, thousands of years later, an analysis of the ancient DNA found in their bones
        has revealed secrets about the people who lived there many millennia ago, according to a new study.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Perhaps the most surprising finding is that these children are not related to the modern-day Bantu-speaking
        cultures that reside in the region today, the researchers said. Rather, the Stone Age youngsters are genetically
        closer to the present-day hunter-gatherer groups of Central Africa, which are not closely related to Bantu
        speaking groups, the researchers found.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        This realization and others, including that a previously unknown "ghost" population contributed genetically to
        the people who live in Africa today, is shedding light on what is still the most genetically diverse region for
        humans in the world today, the researchers said.
    </p>

    <h2>Ancient Rock Shelter</h2>
    <p class="text">
        Researchers have found countless artifacts and 18 human burials at the Shum Laka rock shelter, which people have
        used for at least 30,000 years. But the new study focused on the burials of four children, who lived as the
        Stone Age transitioned into the Metal Age (also called the Stone-to-Metal Age) in western Central Africa.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        This included the remains of a 4-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy found in a double-burial dating to about
        8,000 years ago. The researchers also analyzed the DNA of a 4-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy found in
        neighboring burials dating to about 3,000 years ago, during the late Stone-to-Metal Age.
    <p>

    <p class="text">
        Although they lived thousands of years apart, these children were distant cousins, the researchers found. About
        one-third of their DNA came from ancestors who were more closely related to hunter and gatherers in western
        Central Africa. The other two-thirds came from an ancient source in West Africa, including a "long lost ghost
        population of modern humans that we didn't know about before," study senior researcher David Reich, a population
        geneticist at Harvard University, told Science magazine.
    <p class="text">
        The DNA of these cousins upended a previously held idea. Until now, researchers thought that the Bantu-speaking
        peoples, which includes several hundred indigenous groups in sub-Saharan Africa, originated in this area of
        Central Africa, before radiating out across the lower half of Africa, which includes central, western central,
        eastern and southern Africa. This idea was thought to explain why most of the people from these regions are
        closely related to each other.
    <p class="text">
        But the new genetic analyses show that's not the case. The inhabitants of Shum Laka were not the ancestors of
        Bantu-speaking people at least according to the DNA of these four children.

    </p>

    <p class="text">
        "The finding that the Shum Laka individuals are most related to present day rainforest hunter-gatherers and not
        ancestors of Bantu-speakers is surprising given that Shum Laka was long considered by archeologist[s] as the
        site where Bantu-speaker culture [was] developing in situ," Carina Schlebusch, an evolutionary biologist at the
        University of Uppsala in Sweden, who wasn't involved with the study, told Live Science in an email.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        "However, as the authors mentioned in the article, it might be that multiple groups used the site," Schlebusch
        said. This means that the Bantu's ancestors might have used the site, but it's not shown in these particular
        burials.

    <h2>Ancient Genetics</h2>

    <p class="text">
        The genetic analyses revealed a handful of other findings about the ancient people of Cameroon. For instance,
        one of the boy's genomes revealed that he had the oldest branch of the Y chromosome, which shows that the oldest
        lineage of human males was present in Cameroon for at least 8,000 years, and possibly much longer, the
        researchers said.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        In addition, the analysis suggests that there are at least four major human lineages, which date to between
        200,000 and 300,000 years ago. This realization is unique to this dataset, and hasn't been found from previous
        genetic studies, the researchers said.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        The scientists also found another set of four sub-branches of human lineages that date to between 60,000 and
        80,000 years ago. This includes the lineage that gave rise to all modern non-Africans, the researchers said.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        "It is a nice paper and it is a welcome addition to the growing aDNA [ancient DNA] database of Africa,"
        Schlebusch said. "It is especially valuable to get aDNA from West Africa, where it is well know[n] that the
        preservation of human remains [is] very bad due to the acidic soils."
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        That said, the researchers could have done even more with their unique dataset, she said. For instance, they
        could have visualized effective population sizes over time, Schlebusch said. She added that "the findings
        regarding the deep African population structure are interesting, but we definitely need more testing of possible
        models and most probably more aDNA results before we will be able to disentangle signals."
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        The study, led by scientists at Harvard Medical School, was published online today (Jan. 22) in the journal
        Nature.
